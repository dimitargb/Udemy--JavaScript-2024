In JS every value is either an Object: let me : {
    name: 'Dimitar'
};

Or Primitive value : let firstName: 'Dimitar';
                     let age: 50;

Value is only Primitive, when is not an Object.

There are 7 Primitive Data types: Number, String, Boolean, undifined, null, symbol and BigInt.

1. Number is useed for decimials and integers -> let number = 25;
2. Strings is used for text -> let firstName = 'Dimitar';
3. Boolean is a logical type when one of the logical valuee is true or false, used for taking decisions-> let fullAge = true;
4. Undifined is the value taken by a variable that is not yet defined. This is a variable that we declare, but wihtout asigning.
   This means empty value -> let children; 
5. Null means empty value too.
6. Symbol was introduced with ES 2015(ETMASCRIPT 2015), it defines a unique value that can not be changed.
7.BigInt starting form (ES2020), this is for large integers, another type for numbers.

Dynamyc typing means that we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in the variable.
Insted the data types are detrmined automatically. We can easaly change the value that is hold by a varibale.

In Dynamyc typing if we want to reasing a value, which is alreday assigned we just scip the let or const:

let javaScriptIsFun = true;
    javaScriptIsFun = 'Dimitar';

In JS the value has the type, not the varable. the varable simply store value that has a type !!!
Another specification of the dynamyc typing is that we can assign a new value with a diffrent data type to the same variable.

We can use a special Operator called typeof to show a type of a vlue!!!
