The Operator allows us to transform values or combine multiple values.

1. Mathematical Opertaors: We can use - or +, mulitplication or devision.
    const ageJoanas = 2021 - 1973;
    const ageFranky = 2021 - 1985;

    console.log(ageJoanas, ageFranky);


console.log(ageJoanas, ageFranky);
console.log(ageJoanas * 2, ageJoanas / 2, 2 ** 3);

// 2 ** 3 means two to the power of 3 = 2 * 2 * ;

const firstName = "Dimitar";
const lastName = "Damianov";
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName); -> this is called concatenation.

Assignment Opertator is the equal sign:

let x = 10 + 5; Here the = is an Operator as wel as +;
In this case x will be asigned 15, because the + Operator is executed befoiore the = Operator;

x += 10;
Here to x will be added 10, x was 15 + 10 = 25;
console.log(x) // will be 25
x += 10; // x = x + 10 = 25
x *= 4; // x = x * 4 = 25 * 4 = 100

x++; This is x = x + 1;
x--; This is x = x - 1;

Comparison Operators

We use Comparison Operators to produce a boolean values.
console.log(ageJoanas > ageFranky); -> Tis means is the age of Jonas grater than the age of Frankey and the Operator replys with true or false

console.log(ageFranky >= 18); -> true;
