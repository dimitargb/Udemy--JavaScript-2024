The Boolean Logic usese several Logical Operators to combine true and false values.
Those are the End, Or and Not Operators.

1. The End Operator &&, only if all conditions are true the result of the operstion will be true as well.

Is enought for one Operator to be false to make all Operators false;

The End Operator &&, returns true only if A and B Operations are true, if either A or B are false then all are false.

It will be true if all A, and B are ture, if one of them is false the result is false.

2. The Or Operator ||, will be true if just one of the variables A or B is true!!!

 Even if one Operator is false the other one is true, the result will be ture, bec use we have one 
 which is true.

3. The Not Operator !, this Operator inverts the Boolean value form true to false and ftom false to true.

  The Not Operator !, has a precedence over the other 2 Operators. This means the value are conveted to Not Operator first
  and afetr we use the End or Or Operators.
