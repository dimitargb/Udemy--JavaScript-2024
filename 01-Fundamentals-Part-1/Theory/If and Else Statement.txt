const age = 19;
const isOldEnough = age >= 18;

We have a boolean isOldEnough which can be wither true or false.
in the if(here goes the condition) if is true, tha the block{} will be executed!!!

const age = 16;
const isOldEnough = age >= 18;

if (isOldEnough) {
  console.log("Dimitar can start driving license coureses ðŸš—!");
} else {
  const yearsLeft = 18 - age;
  console.log(
    `Ivan has ${yearsLeft} years, untill he starts his driving license coureses ðŸ˜„!`
  );
}

If esle is called if else cotrol structure!!! Is called cotrol structure becuse it gives us the option to 
have more control over the way the our code is executed.

Exsample:

const birthYear = 1991;
let century;

if (birthYear <= 2000) {
  century = 20;
} else {
  century = 21;
}
console.log(century);
