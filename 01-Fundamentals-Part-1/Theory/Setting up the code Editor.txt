Before we write any code we need to install and configute a code editor. A code editor is the main tool for any developer
and we use it to write our code. We will use Visual Studio Code or vs code. We can istall a Monokai Pro Theme, but this is paid
Another Theme is Monokai Classic wich is free.

Now about vscode settings:

The first setting is Auto Save that should be set to onFocusChange. this will automaticcaly save the file,
wihout me having ot do enything.

Another one is Multi Cursor Modifier - we leave it at alt.

World Wrap - on.

Another important one is -> Format On Save, it has to be picked.

To open the editor on a Page press Ctrl + Shift + J.
