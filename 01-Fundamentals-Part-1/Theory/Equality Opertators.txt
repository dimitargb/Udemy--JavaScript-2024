Lets suppose we want to check if 2 values are actually equal. For that we use the equality Operstors.

const age = 18;
if(age === 18)console.log("You just became an adult 😃");

Whenever our if block only has one line we don't need the curly brackets{}!!!

age === 18 This is called Comparison Operator!!!
const age = 18; This is the Assignment Operator!!!

We also have a == equal.

The === equal is called the Strict Equality Operator. Is strict because not perform type coertion and it only
returns true when both values are exactely the same.


The == equal is called the Loose Equality Operator. This equality Operator deos type coercion.

'18' == 18 -> This '18' will be converted to a number. // true, becuse it converts it to a number;
'18' === 18 -> This will be false, becouse it does not covert it to a number.

We can get a value from a web page by using a prompt() function!!!

//Usingthe prompt() function.
const favourite = Number(prompt(`What's is your favorite number?`));
console.log(typeof favourite);

if (favourite === 5) console.log("Cool! This is the right number 😍.");
else if (favourite === 8) console.log("This number is also cool 🤟.");
else console.log("This is not the correct number 😠.");

// Diffrent Operator:

if (favourite !== 5) console.log("Why not 23 ?");
