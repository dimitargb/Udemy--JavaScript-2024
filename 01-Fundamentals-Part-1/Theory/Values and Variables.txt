Value is basically a piece of data.
For exsample 'Dimitar' is a value.

So value is the smallest unit of information that we have in JS.

We store value into variables.
This way we can reuse them over and over again.

For exsample: let firstName = "Dimitar";
    firstName is a variable;
    'Dimitar' is a value;

This is called declaring a variable: let firstName = "Dimitar;
This way we declare a varibale in the computer's memory and store that value in this memory.

console.log(firstName); the result will be the value from this varable -> 'Dimitar';

Convetions and Rules on how to name the variables. The first way is camle Case -> firstName.
First word is with lower case second with Upper Case.

Other way is:
firt_name

SyntaxError as a worning that we have a mistake in writing our code.
The variable name can only contain numbers, letters, underscore or the dollar sign.

We can not use names which are apready taken by JS for exsample function or new.
We can use function variable iwht an uderscore like this: 
let _function = 35;

We can not start a varable name with an uppercase Letter. 
let Person = 'Vacum'; -> this is a convetion.

Finally our varable names must be descriptive. When we name our variables they should be easy to understand
what value they hold so we can easy understand the vsriable.
Exsample:

let myFirstJob = 'Programmer';
let myCurrentJob = 'Teacher';

is much better then write let job1 = 'Programmer', let job2 = 'Teacher';
