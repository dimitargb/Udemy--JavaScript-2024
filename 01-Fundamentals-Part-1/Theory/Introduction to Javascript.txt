JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
A programming language is a language that will instruct the computer to do something.
Object oriented menas that JavaScript is mostly based on Objects, for storing most kind of data.
A multi-paradigm  language means that JavaScript si so flexibale and versitale, that we can use all kinds of
diffrent programming styles such as imperative and declerative programming styles.
This diffrent styles are just diffrent ways of structuring our code.

The role of JavaScript in the web development:

The 3 technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript all work together to create beautiful, interactive and dynamyc websites or
web applications.

The HTML is responsable for the content of the page - text, images, buttons.

The CSS is responsable for the presentation of that content - styling and layout of the elemenst in the web page.

JavaScript is the real programming language of the internet and it allows developers to add dynamyc and interactive
effects to any web page. We also use it to manipulate the content of the CSS, load data from remote Servers and building
applications in the brousers, wich we call web applications.

JavaScript allows us to add dynamyc effect to pages and to build entire web applications in the brouser.
With React, Angualar and Vue Frameworks and Libraries help JavaScript write large application a lot easyer and faster.
Those Frameworks and Libraries are 100% based on JavaScript.

JavaScript can also run autside of the web brousers. You can use JavaScript on a web Servers, using a NodeJs technology, which
does not need any brousers at all and allows us to create Back-end applications. They run on a web Server and iteracts With
the applications.

On the other hand, when we use JavaScript in the brouser we create the so called Front-End applications. We can use JavaScript,
to build mobile applications and native desctop applications.

JavaScript releases -> ES/6(ES2015) (ES means ECMA Script). The Modern JavaScript starts form ES/6 or ES2015.
