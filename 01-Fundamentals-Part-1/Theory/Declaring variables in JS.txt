We use the let keyword to declare variables that can change later.
In thechnical terms we call this reasigning a value to a variable. It means we muteted the variable.
During the execution of the program. Example:

let age = 30;
age = 50;

We use the const keyword to declare a varable that are not supposed to change at any point in a future.
So the vaue in a conat variable can not be changed. 
The const keyword creates a immutable variable, a varable that can not be mutated.

We can not declare empty const variables !!! Example:

const toy;

We recommend to use const by default and let only when you are sure that the varable will change in the future.


Let is block scope and var is function scope!!!
