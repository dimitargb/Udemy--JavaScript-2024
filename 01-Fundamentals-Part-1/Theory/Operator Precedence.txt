We type in the google search -> mdn operator precedence.
Usually all the Math operators are executed before the comparison operators.

Assignment is exsample of right to left execution.

let y, z;

y = z = 25 - 10 - 5;
console.log(y, z); z = 10, y = 10  because assigment is working from right to left!

Very important - Operations within brackets(скоби) will be executed first!!!

A great example is to calculate the avarage of 2 values.

Calculating the avarage
const avarageAge = ageJoanas + ageFranky / 2;
console.log(ageJoanas, ageFranky, avarageAge); // avarageAge = 66;

The reason is becuse the devision is happening before the addition according to the Opertaor precedence Table
We need to put the addition in brackets so this operation to be executed first and then the devision.

const avarageAge1 = (ageJoanas + ageFranky) / 2;
console.log(avarageAge1); // avarageAge now is 42;
