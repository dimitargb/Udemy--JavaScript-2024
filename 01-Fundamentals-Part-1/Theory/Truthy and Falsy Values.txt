Falsy Values a values that are not exactely false but will become false, when we try to convert them into a boolean.

In JS there are only 5 falsy values:

0, '', undifined, null, NaN;

Only this values will be converted to false, when we attemp to covert them to a boolean!!!

Everything else a called Truthy Values!!!

If we want to convert a vlue to Boolean we use the Boolean() function.

In practice the convertion to a Boolean is always coertion, JS does this automatically for us. this happends when we use
logical operations and when we use if else statements.

Exsample:
const money = 0;

if (money) {
  console.log(`Don't spend it all!`);
} else {
  console.log("You should get a job!");
}

JS wil try to convert everything which is in the brackets(money) into a Boolean. And because money = 0 and we knwo that 0 is 
falsy value, the satement will be false and that's why the else statement will be executed.

Another use case is to check if a variable is actualy defined or not.

let hight;
if (hight) {
  console.log("Hight is DEFINED");
} else {
  console.log("Hight is UNDEFINED");
}

Result is 'Hight is UNDEFINED' because hight is undefined, that's why the else statement is executed.
