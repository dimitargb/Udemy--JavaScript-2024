The Conditional Operator allows us to write something silar to the if / else statement, but all in one line.

This Conditional Operator is called the Ternary Operator because it has 3 Parts -> The Condition age >= 18 ?;
than the if Part ? console.log('I like to drink wine 🍷') and the else Part console.log('I like to drink wine 🚰');

The Operator always produces a value.
In other words an operator is an expression. This means that if we have a value we can than assign this value to a veriable.
In this way we can make a Ternary Operator very usefull in conditionally declaring variables.

const age = 23;
age >= 18 ? console.log('I like to drink wine 🍷') : console.log('I like to drink wine 🚰');

So this Expression produces a value and we can store that value into a variable.

const drink = age >= 18 ?'wine 🍷' : 'water 🚰';
console.log(drink);

Because the variable drink is an expression  we can put this inot a Template Literals for a  result.
Here we can not use a Ternary Operator, so we use the expression as a variable, because it produces a value.

console.log(`I'd like to drink ${age >= 18 ? "wine 🍷" : "water 🚰"}`);
