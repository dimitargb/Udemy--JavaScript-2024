Here we start with the prepared html file. 
We add an script to the head tag in the HTML:
 <script>
      let js = "amaizing";
      if (js === "amaizing") alert("JavaScript is Fun!");

      40 + 8 + 23 - 10;
      console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
    </script>

This script is called inline script!!! The only adavantage of the inline script is that we dont have to load another file.
Usually we use externsl JS file.
So we create a new file called script.js

We copy the script code from the HTML file and paste it into the new script.js file.
Now we can remove the script form the HTML file.

We connect the script.js using script in the HTML file. Here we naeed to specify the name of the file and the location.

 <script src="script.js"></script>

 Here we dont have to specify the entire path to the file because script.js is in the same folder as the index.html file.
