Expression is a piece of code that produces a value!!

Exsample: 3 + 4 is an expression, because it produces a value.
Exsample: 1992
Exsample: true && false && !false


Statement is a bigger pice of code that is executed and wich is not producing a value!!

if(20 > 10) {
    const str = '20 is bigger'
};

This Statement does not procuse a value.

For exsample in the Template Literal we can only insert experssions, but not statements.
