let js = "amaizing";
40 + 8 + 23 - 10;

console.log("dimitar");
console.log(35);

let firstName = "Dimitar";
// firstName is a variable
// 'Dimitar' is a value

// this way we declare a varibale in the computer's memory and store that value in this memory.
console.log(firstName);

//The variable name can only contain numbers, letters, underscore or the dollar sign.
let eoro3$_score = 2;
console.log(eoro3$_score);

let _function = 35;

//We can not start a varable name with an uppercase Letter.
// let Person = 'Vacum'; -> this is a convetion.
// Wich is Object Oriented Programming

let Person = "Vacum";
// but write it with a lower case:
let person = "Vacum";

/*Finally our varable names must be descriptive. When we name our variables they should be easy to understand
what value they hold so we can easy understand the vsriable.
Exsample:*/

let myFirstJob = "Programmer";
let myCurrentJob = "Teacher";

//is much better then write let job1 = 'Programmer', let job2 = 'Teacher';
