If we want to add a new propery to an object we create one and set it to some value.

const jonas = {
  firstName: "Jonas",
  lastName: "Schmedtmann",
  age: 2037 - 1991,
  job: "teacher",
  friends: ["Michael", "Peter", "John"],
};

jonas.location = "USA";

console.log(jonas["location"]); // USA

Challange ->wriet ot the console wihtout using hrdcodet names or numbers
        'Jonas has 3 friends and his best friend is called Michael':

Solution:

const interestedIn = prompt(
  `${jonas.firstName} has ${jonas.friends.length} friends and his best friend is called ${jonas.friends[0]}.`
);

if (jonas[interestedIn]) {
  console.log(jonas[interestedIn]);
} else {
  console.log(
    "Wrong request! What do you want to know about Jonas? Choose between firstName, lastName, age ,job and friends?"
  );
}
