In the while Loop we still need a counter rep = 1, we still need a condition rep <= 10 and we stil need to increase te counter somehow.

For the While Loop we can only specify a condition!!!

While loop -> here we can specify only the condition.
We want to keep the loop running wile the repetition is <= 10
The While Loop will run while the condition is true => while (repetition <= 10);

We need to manualy difine the other 2 components of the for Loop -> counter and counter increase.
We need to this outside the loop. We start weith rep = 1;

Then at the end of the iteration we wil then increse the counter -> repetition++

let repetition = 1;
while (repetition <= 10) {
  console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${repetition} 🏋️`);
  repetition++;
}

The While Loop is more versitile, which menas that it can be used in larger variaty of situations.
This is because it does not really need a counter. The only thing the While Loop needs is the condition
in order to keep running. That condition can be any condition, it does not have to be related to any counter
at all. So we can sole a problem wihtout a counter, wihtout a number that is increasing.

Exsample: Let's roll a dice and keep rolling the dice intill we roll a six.
And then when we roll a six we stop. So we dont know how many times the loop shoild run, so we dont need a counter varaible.

let dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
//console.log(dice);
while (dice !== 6) {
  console.log(`You rolled a ${dice}`);
  dice = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
  if (dice === 6) {
    console.log(`Loop reached 6 and is over!`);
  }
}

Conclusion: We use while loop whenever we do not know before how many iterations the loop will have!!!
