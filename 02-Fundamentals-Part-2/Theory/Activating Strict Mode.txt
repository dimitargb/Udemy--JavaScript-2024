Activating Strict Mode. 

Strict Mode is a special Mode in JS, wich makes it easyer for us to write secure JS code.
What we have to do is only write the string 'use strict' in the beginning of the script.js file.

This statement has to be  the very first statement in the script.
We use it always in the beginning of each script.

'use strict'

Strict Mode makes it easyer to avoid excidental errors.

Strict Mode vorbiddes us to do certain things and it will create visable errors for us in certain situations in which without
Stric Mode the code will fail silently without letting us know that we made a mistake.

Another thing that Strict Mode does is to intriduce a short list of variable names that are reserved for.

Here we get an Error message from the consoly, syaing that that variable is a reverved word and we can not use it.
