Lets see how we can call one function fron another function.

function cutFruitPieces(fruit) {
  return fruit * 4;
}

function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  const applePieces = cutFruitPieces(apples);
  const orangePieces = cutFruitPieces(oranges);

  const juice = `Juice with ${applePieces} pieces of apples and ${orangePieces} pieces of .`;

  return juice;
}

console.log(fruitProcessor(2, 3));

Here we have 2 functions, the second function is calling the first function in order to calculate the fruit pieces.
