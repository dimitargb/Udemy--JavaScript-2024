Functions are one of the most essential concepts on the JS Language.

A function is simply a piece of code, that we can reuse over and over again, it can also recive data and return data back.
Let's create a function which logs somthing to the console.

function logger() { all the code in this block is called -> Function body}

function logger() {
  console.log("My name is Dimitar.");
}

logger();
logger();
logger();

To call the function we write the function name followed form brackets -> logger();
This is called invoking a function, running or calling the function.
Each time we call the function the code will be executed !!!

Usually when we write functions we also pass data into the function. the function can also return data as well.

Exsample:

New Exsample with functions parameters.Those Parameters are se#pecific only for this function.
We give to this function 2 Parameters(apples, oranges). Those 2 Parameters will get defined, once the function is called.
Those 2 represent the input data of this function.

With the return keyword we can return any value from the function.
return juice; this will be teh result when executing the function.

function fruitProcessor(apples, oranges) {
  console.log(apples, oranges);
  const juice = `Juice with ${apples} apples and ${oranges} oranges`;

  return juice;
}

fruitProcessor(5, 0); -> those Parameters when we call the function(5, 0) are called arguments!!!

If we want to use the value that was retuned in the function, we need to store it in a variable.
const appleJuice = fruitProcessor(5, 0);
and than log the captured value to the console.
console.log(appleJuice);

We can also directly log the value, without capturing it to a new vafriable:
console.log(fruitProcessor(5, 0));

Now we van reuse the function with diffrent input values and get a diffrent autput.
