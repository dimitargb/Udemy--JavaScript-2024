Push Method -> this method adds Elements to the end of the array!

const friends = ["Mihael", "Peter", "John"];
friends.push('Jay);
console.log(friends); // ["Mihael", "Peter", "John", "Jay"];

So push is a function that we call this function directly on the frinds array.
This mutates the original array.
Since push is a function here it can also return something. The push function does return a value and the value that it
retirns is the length of the new array.
So if we want to capture that value we can create a new variable for that.

const newLength = friends.push("Pappy");
console.log(newLength);

Unshift method -> adds Elements to the beginning of the array.

Just like the push method, the unshift method also returns the lemght of the new array:
friends.unshift("Ema");
console.log(friends);

To get the lenght of the new array we simply store the result 
const arrayLength = friends.unshift("Ema");
console.log(arrayLength);

Pop method -> will remove the last Element of the array.
friends.pop();

The pop method reurns the removed Element.
const popMethod = friends.pop();
console.log(popMethod);

Shift method -> removes the first Element of the array:
This method will return waht was removed.
friends.shift();
console.log(friends);
