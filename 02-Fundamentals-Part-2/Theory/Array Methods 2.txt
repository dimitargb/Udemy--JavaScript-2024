Another method wuch tells us in wich position a certain Element is in the array.

IndexOf method -> tells us the position of the Element in the array.
Inside we pass the name of the Element we are looking for.

const friends = ["Mihael", "Peter", "John", "Jay"];
console.log(frinds.indexOf("Jay")); // 3;
If we try the same with an Element which isw not in the array we aill get result -1;

The value -1 means this Element is not in the array!


Includes method -> will return true if the Element is in the Array and false if is not inside:

console.log(friends.includes("Pirelli")); // false
console.log(friends.includes("Jay")); // true

This method ueses strict equality for this check.

friends.push(23);
console.log(friends.includes('23')); // false because is strict equality and not type coarsion.
console.log(friends.includes(23)); // true  becuse both are numbers.

We can use this mthod to write conditionals, that's one of the very useful application of this method.
if (friends.includes("Peter")) {
  console.log("You have a friend called.");
} else {
  console.log("You dont have a friend with such name.");
}
