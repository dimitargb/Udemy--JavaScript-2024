We get the property out of the object using the property name itself.

1. Way of getting the property from an object is by using the dot(.) notation.
   The dot(.) is an operator wich will go to this object and then retrive the  property that we specify.
const jonas = {
  firstName: "Jonas",
  lastName: "Schmedtmann",
  age: 2037 - 1991,
  job: "teacher",
  friends: ["Michael", "Peter", "John"],
};

console.log(jonas.age); // 46

2. We can do the same thing wiht the brackets notation[].
   Here we need to specify a string wiht the property name.

   console.log(jonas["lastName"]); // Schmedtmann

   Here in the brackest[] we can put any expession we like.
   In the square brackets[] we can put any expression here:

    const nameKey = "Name";
    const teaching = 20;
    console.log(jonas["first" + nameKey]);
    console.log(jonas["last" + nameKey]);

    We get undifined when we try to acsess a property in an object that does not exsist -> undifined !!!

    Let's say we dont know yet whichproperty we want to show adn we get this information form some user interface.
    For that we can use the propmt() function.
    This function wil return a string wich we have to store in a avriable.

    const interestedIn = prompt("What do you want to know about /jonas? Choose between firstName, lastName, age ,job and friends");
    console.log(jonas[interestedIn]);  
    JavaScript will come to interestedIn and replace the variable value with the one we choose from prompt function!!!
