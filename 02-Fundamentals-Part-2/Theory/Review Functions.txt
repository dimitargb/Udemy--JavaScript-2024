const yearsUntilRetirement = (birthYear, firstName) => {
  const age = 2037 - birthYear;
  const retirement = 65 - age;

  //return retirement;
  return `${firstName} retires in ${retirement} years from now.`;
};

The first thing we are going to do is to covert it to function expression. To do this we write function infront the Parameters
and remove the arrow.

const yearsUntilRetirement1 = function (birthYear, firstName) {
  const age = 2037 - birthYear;
  const retirement = 65 - age;

  //return retirement;
  return `${firstName} retires in ${retirement} years from now.`;
};

// The return keyword will immidately exit the function once it retuns the value that we told him to return.

All of the 3 types of function fucntions Declarations, function Expressions and Arrow functions can recieve input data,
they can transform data and they can output data.
