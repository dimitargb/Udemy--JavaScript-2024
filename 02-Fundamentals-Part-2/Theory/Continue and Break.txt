Continue.

Continue means to exit the current iteration of the loop and coninue to the next one.

const jonas = [
  "Jonas",
  "Schmedtmann",
  2037 - 1991,
  "teacher",
  ["Mihael", "Maria", "John"],
  true,
];

for (let i = 0; i < jonas.length; i++) {
  if (typeof jonas[i] !== "string") continue;

  console.log(jonas[i], typeof jonas[i]);
}

Lets say for some reason we only want to print Elemnts that are strings. The Continue statement is perfect
for this becuse with it we can exit the current iteration of the loop.
if jonas[i] !== "string" is not a string then continue;
This way we only get strigs now.
In other words ignore Elements that are not strings!!

Break is used to completyely terminate the whole loop, not just the current iteration.
What we want to do now is to log no other elements after we found a number!!! After the number nothing else should be printed.
