Loops are cotrol structures. 
Loops allow us to automate repitative tasks. Tasks that we have to perform over and over again.
The loop will run a code over and over again, untill we tell him to stop.

The loop Statement has 3 Parts.
1. Part is the value of a counter. 
   The counter will start form 1 and will go stop where we tell him to stop.
   Lets cal the counter rep from repetitions, we start from 1

2. Part is a logical condition that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. Before each time the code in the loop is 
   executed.
   Our condition is rep to stay below or equal to 10. If the condition is true the next iteration will run, but as soon 
   the condition is false the loop will stop.
   The loop will keep wrunning until this condition rep <= 10 is true.

3. Part we update the counter aftereach iteration.
   Waht we do here is encrease the counter by 1 after each iteration. (rep++)

 
  
for (let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++) {
  console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep} 🏋️`);
}

// Lifting weights repetition 1 🏋️

What the loop does is to verify before each repetition if the condition in Part 2 is still true and only if it is still true
it will keep running the Loop.
