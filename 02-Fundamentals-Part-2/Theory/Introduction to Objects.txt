Objects are Data Structure in JavaScript. Here we difine key - value pairs.
So we can give each value a name.

const jonasArray  = ["Jonas", "Schmedtmann", 2037 - 1991, "teacher", ["Michael", "Peter", "John"]]; 

the key is the varaible name -> firstName and the value is the actual name: 'Jonas'.
the value can be of any type we want here !!!

Each of this keys(variable name) are also called properties!!!
The objects jonas has 5 properties: firstName, lastName, age, job, friends array.

This is called Object literal syntax - because we are literally writing down the entire object content.

const jonas = {
    firstName: 'Jonas',
    lastName: 'Schmedtmann',
    age: 2037 - 1991,
    job: "teacher",
    friends: ["Michael", "Peter", "John"],
}

So we use Objects to group together different variables.
The big diffrence between objects and arrays is that in objects the order of this values does not metter at all
when we want to retrive them.

This menas that we should use arrays for more ordered data and objects for more unstructured data.
Data that we want to name and then retrive form the object based on that name.
