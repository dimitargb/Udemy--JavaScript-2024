Any unexpected or unintendet behavior of a programm is called a bug. To fix a bug we use a process called debugging which is finding, fixing and preventing bugs.

First we need to be aware that somwhere there is a bug. Next we need to find where exactely is the bug happening.

Once we know where the bug is located we can finally fixed it and correct it. What we need to do id to replace the wrong
solution with the correct solution.

Finally we should prevent thr bug from ever happening again.

In the brackets we put the argument, arguments()

const measureKalvin = function () {

};

Another way of showing Objects in a console is console.tabe():

 const measuerement = {
    type: "temprature",
    unit: "celcius",
    value: prompt("Degrees celcius:"),
  };

  console.tabe(measuerement)
