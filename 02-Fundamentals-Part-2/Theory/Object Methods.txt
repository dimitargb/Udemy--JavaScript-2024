Objects can hold diffrent types of data, they can hold arrays and even objects inside objects.
Functions are just really another tyoe of value. 
And if a Functions is just a value, then that means that we can create a
key - value pair in wich the value is the function.

This means that we can add Functions to Objects.
 We gonna add to our Object the calcAge() function.

 We add the function name as a property and we specify the function as an expression(function expression).

const jonas = {
  firstName: "Jonas",
  lastName: "Schmedtmann",
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: "teacher",
  friends: ["Michael", "Peter", "John"], // to get the lenght write ${jonas.friends.length !!!
  hasDriversLicence: true,
  calcAge: function (birthYear) {
    return 2037 - birthYear;
  },
};

calling the calcAge property:
console.log(jonas.calcAge(1992)); // 45

So any function that is attached to an Obejst is called a method.

To inderstand value in an Object 
firstName: we have a string value
birthYear: we have a number value
friends: we have an array value
hasDriversLicence: we have a boolean value
calcAge: we have a function value(here we use a function expression)

Function expression is a function wich value is stored in a variable.
