Using this keyword in Objects.
The birthYear is hardcoded in the object, so in calcAge(birthYear) must always be 1991 as in the Obeject.
We can access the birthYear propery directly from the jonas Object, insted if having to pass it in.

In every method JavaScript gives us access to a special varable called this.
So in the calcAge() we can read the birthYear directly from the object itself, without having to pass it in as 
a Parameter.
The this keyword is equal to the object on which the method id called. The Object who is calling the method is jonas.
This menas the this keyword will point to jonas.

const jonas = {
  firstName: "Jonas",
  lastName: "Schmedtmann",
  birthYear: 1991,
  job: "teacher",
  friends: ["Michael", "Peter", "John"],
  hasDriversLicence: true,

   calcAge: function () {
    console.log(this); // this is the whole jonas Object
    return 2037 - this.birthYear; // using this keyword
  },
};

console.log(jonas.calcAge()) // 46  we dont need to pass 1991 becuse this keyword is pointing to birthYear.

Let's say we need to access the age muliple time through our programm. This means we need to call the function many times:

console.log(jonas.calcAge())
console.log(jonas.calcAge())
console.log(jonas.calcAge())

Instead what we can do is calculate the age once, than store it in the Object jonas and than when we need it in 
a later point we can then just retrieve the age as property from the Object.
We can use the this keyword also to store a new property !!! We can sat this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear.
So we create a new proerty called age:

  calcAge: function () {
    this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear; // using this keyword
    return;
  },
};

To add a new property from a function we use the this keyword -> this.age = 2037 - this.birthYear;  and we add the property age;
Here we are creating jonas.age proeprty.

We have to know that arrays ara also Ojects, just special kind of objects. They have functions or in other words methods
that we can use to manipulate them like push, pop, shif, unshift, and many more. This means that array are also ojects, 
that's thay have methods as well.
