1. JavaScript is a Language that has First Class Functions.

This means that Functions a simply treated sa values. 
Functions are really just another type of Objects and since Objects are values, Functions are values too.
So we can store functions in variables or Object properties.

We can also pass functions as arguments to other functions, for example when adding eventHandlesrs or eventListeners to
DOM Objects.

We can also return a function from another function.
Functions are Objects and many type of Objects in JavaScript have methods. Those are function methods,
so methids that we can call on functions.

2. Higher Order Functions.

A Higher Order Function is either a function that recieves another function as argumnet, or a function that returns
a new Function.

a.) Function that recieves another Function:

const greet() => console.log('Hey Jonas');
btnClose.addeventListener('click', greet);

Here addeventListener() is a Higher Order Function becuse it recieves another Function greet.
We usually say thet the Function that is passes in greet() is a CallBack Function, becuse the CallBack Function will
be called later by the Higher Order Function as soon as the 'click' event happends.

b.) Function that returns another Function:
 
function count() {
    let counter = 0;

    return function() {
        counter++;
    }
}
