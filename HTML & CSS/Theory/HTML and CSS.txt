The only thing we need to do is to type ! and a new htm will open!!!

index.html is always the main fail in any project.
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language. We use it to descibe the content of web pages.
we write <html></html>
It always has a head and a body -> <head> <body>
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body></body>
</html>

Whatever we put in the head is like the settings of the page, for example the title.
Whenever we put onto the body, will be actually visable on the page.
