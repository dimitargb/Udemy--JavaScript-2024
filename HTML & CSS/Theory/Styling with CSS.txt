We ca write css write in the html file usong the style element.
<style></style>.
The style element should go into the head.

To style Elements we need first to select them.
The most common is the elemtn selector , for exsample body.

So we write body, then curly bracers {
   backgroundcolor: azure,
} and inside we write our CSS declaration, for example background color: azure.

What is written in the curly bracers is the - declaration block and  backgroundcolor: azure, is the declaration,
where backgroundcolor is a property and azure is the spcified value.

But usually we write our css in an exertanl css file, like we write JS in an external script.

So let's create this separate css file and call it style.css

We link the style.css file to the html element by using the link element. And we need to cpecify the rel attribute and select
it to stylesheet.
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"/>

Now we can write all our styles in a separate file.
We add the font-family property to Arial:

body {
  background-color: rgb(255, 247, 201);
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
   font-size: 20px;
}

The font family property is a property that gets inherited. So all the child elements of the body element, will 
automatically the font-family asigned to them.

Now most peoperties will not be inherited, but generally all the peoperties related to fints will be inherit.
Like font-size for exsample and let set it to 20 px.

We have diffrent font-sixes for h1 and for h2 wich are predifined in the html file, but we can override them by
specifying diffrent values in the style.css file.


h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}

Now lets select elements based on their classes. For exsample we have mulitple elements wich have class 'first'.
The Class selector is using the dot(.) -> .first

.first {
  color: red;
}

And now both paragraphs wiht this class name are coler red.

Finally let's also format our form, here we have the id = 'your-name'.
To select an id instead of dot we use the # symbol. 

#your-name {
  background-color: #ffe600;
  border: 5px solid #444444a0;
}
