The attributes basically descibe the elements.
Let's create a link which is inside of the pararaph. We can nest elements inisde one another.
For exsample h1 and p are child elemnts of the body element.
To add a link we use the ancor element <a href></a>.
Here we descibe the ancor element using the href attribute.

href -> hypertext reference, this is an inline element.
h2 -> is a block element, becuse it created a new line.

Another element which needs attributes is th image element.
For image we use the <img src=""> Tag and the src attribute. then in here we can specify any image form the 
current Folder or we can set the image url.
The image element does not have a closing Tag and we need to close it oursef.

As we see diffrent elements have diffrent attributes.

There are 2 very important attributes, that we can use on all elements - > Classes and Id.
We use Classes and Id -s to name elements so we can select them in CSS in order to style them and also 
to selct them in JS when we do DOM manilulations. So Classes and Id are very important for identify elements.
We can add them on any element. So let's add a class to the first pararaph.

Besides Classes we also have id and let's add one tho the image called 'course-image'.
The diffrence betweeen Classes and id, is that id have to be unique!!!
Each id can only be used once on the page. while Classes can be used over and over again.

So now lets create a HTML form which has to be in a box. The most generic box is a div element.
<div></div>
In CSS we use a dash - to connect two words by nameing classes ot id. For exsamle: id="course-image".
Than we craete a heding for this form:
<h2>Your name here!</h2>
Than we add another pararaph here:
<p>Please fill in this form :)</p>
And now lets use an input element. Here we yse the type attribute to specify the type of data that should be inputet into the elelent and we can specify a placehodlder as well.
<input type="text" placeholder="Type your name here" />
And then the form usually has a button, so we have than a button element.
<button></button>

Insted if <div></div> we use <form></form> when we have a form like here.

 <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Type your name here" />
      <button>OK!</button>
</form>
