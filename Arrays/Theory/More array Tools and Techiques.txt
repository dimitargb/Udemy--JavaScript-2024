1. We can group arrays by different Categories by using the Object.groupBy function

2. If we want to create a new Array from scratch we can use Array.from Function, or we can use the array Constructor
   new Array(n) and pass the number of the empty elements(n), that this array contains.
   
   new Array(n) -> creating new array with n empty Positions(use together with fill method).

3. To join 2 or more arrays we can use the spread Operator:

   [...arr1, ...arr2]

4. If we wsnt to get all the unuque values of an array we can placed them into a new Set:

   [...new Set(arr)]

5. If we want to find all Elements present in 2 arrays, we can covert them into Set's, use the intersection method on the Set 
   and the spread the result into a bran new array:

   [...new Set(arr1).intersection(new Set(arr2))];
