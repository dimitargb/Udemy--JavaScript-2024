The Nullish Coalescing Operator works wiht the idea of Nullish(0) values instead of falsy values.

The Nullish coalescing (??) operator is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

Nullish Values are null and undifined it does not include 0 or empty String('')!!!

So when we using the Nullish Coalescing Operator 0 and empty String are not falsy values but thruty values.
Falsy values when we using the Nullish Operator are null and undefined.

restaurant.numGuests = 0;
const guests = restaurant.numGuests || 10; // It will return the first truthy value => restaurant.numGuests = 23
/*Because 0 is a falsy value it will return 10 wich is the thruty value*/
console.log(guests);

const guestsCorrect = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10; // 0 -> Nullish Coalescing Operator;
/*If we use the Nullish Operator it will return 0 becuse it does not include 0 or empty String*/
console.log(guestsCorrect);

// To solve the problem if the numGuests is set to 0, we use the Nullish Assignment Operator ??
// Nullish Assignement Operator
rest1.numGuests ??= 10; // 0
rest2.numGuests ??= 10; // 10

console.log(rest1);
console.log(rest2);
