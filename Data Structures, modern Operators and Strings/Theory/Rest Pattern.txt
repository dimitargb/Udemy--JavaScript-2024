We use the Spread Operator to build new Arrays, or to pass mulitple values in a function.
We use the Spread Operator into individual Elements.

The Rest Pattern is to pack Elements into an Array.

It is called Rest Operator becuse it will take the rest of the Elments of the array and then put them into a new Array.
others is a new array.

The rest Pattern must alwys be the last in the distructuring assignment.

// 1. Destructuring

// Spread Operator becuse we are using it on the right side of =
const arr = [1, 2, ...[3, 4]];
console.log(arr);

//Rest Patern
//Here is the Rest Syntax becuse is on the left sife f the assignment =
const [a, b, ...others] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(a, b, others); // 1, 2, [3, 4, 5]
console.log(others); // [3, 4, 5]

/*It is called Rest Operator becuse it will take the rest of the Elments of the array and then put them into a new Array.
others is a new array.*/

const [pizza, , risotto, ...otherFood] = [
  ...restaurant.mainMenu,
  ...restaurant.starterMenu,
];

console.log(pizza, risotto, otherFood);

// Objects
// Now lets do the rest Operator in Objects, the remaining Elements will be collected into a new Object.
const { sat, ...weekdays } = restaurant.openingHours;
console.log(weekdays);


//2. Functions with rest Operator
/* The rest syntax is taking mulitple numbers and packed them all inot one array [5, 2, 4, 7, 9]*/
const add = function (...numbers) {
  console.log(numbers);
};
add(5, 2, 4, 7, 9); // [5, 2, 4, 7, 9]

With the Rest Syntax we pack Elements together, with the rest we expand Elements.

The Spread Operator is used where we would otherwise write values separated by comma !!!
The Rest Pattern is used where we would otherwise write variable names separated by comma !!!
