There are 3 sources of Data:

1. - Within the programm source code itself(status messages).
2. - Data can come from the User Interface(UI). User can input Data.
3. - Data can come form external sources. Data fetched from the API(Application Programming Interface).
     We can use API to get Data from other applications.

     No matter how we get the Data, we usually have the so called Colletions of Data.

     To store Colletions of Data we use Data Structures.There are 4 Data Structures in JS - Arrays, Objects, Sets and Maps.

A.) If we jsut need a simple list of values we use an Array or a Set.
    Here we have the values without any description.
B.) If we need need a key-value pair, then we need an Object or Map.
    With the key-value pair we have a way of discribing the values, by usinf the key.

For example if we are getting Data form a Web API, it usually comes in a special Data Format called JSON.
JSON can easily be converted to JavaScript Object. 
The most commen in JavaScript is createing an Array of Objects, becuse we need a list of Objects.

We use Arrays or Sets when we need a list of values, but we do not need to describe the value.

1. Use Arrays whenever you need to store values in order and when this values might contain duplicates.
   Use Arrays when you need to manipulate Data.

2. Use Sets when you are working wiht unique values.
   Use Sets when you need to remove duplicate values from an Array.

3. Use Objects whenever we need to disribe the values using keys.
   They are easier to write and access values.
   When you need functions for values, you need to use an Object for that.
   Also when working with JSON Data you will most likly use Objects, unless you want to convert the Objects to Maps.

4. Use Maps for key-values stores.
   Map's keys can have any data tyep and have better performance.
   They are easyer to iterate and it is easier to compute the size of a Map.
   Use Maps whe you need keys that are not strigns.
