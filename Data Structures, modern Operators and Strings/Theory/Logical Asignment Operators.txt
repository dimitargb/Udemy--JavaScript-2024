const rest1 = {
  name: 'Capri',
  //numGuests: 20,
  // If we set the number of guests to 0
  numGuests: 0,
};

const rest2 = {
  name: 'La Piazza',
  owner: 'Jovanni Rossi',
};

1. The OR assignment Operator:

What we want to do now is to set a default number of guets for all the resturant Objects that do not have that property*/
The OR Operator assignes a value to a variable, if that variable is currently falsy

/OR assignment Operator/
rest1.numGuests = rest1.numGuests || 10;
rest2.numGuests = rest2.numGuests || 10; -> exactely what happend here 

Those are the same as the ones above!!!

/OR assignment Operator/
rest1.numGuests ||= 10; // OR Logical Assignment Operator

Exactely what happend here rest2.numGuests variable is currently falsy, the value 10 is assigned!!!
rest2.numGuests ||= 10; // OR Logical Assignment Operator
console.log(rest1);
console.log(rest2);

2. The Logical AND Assignment Operator.

// rest1.owner = rest1.owner && '<ANONIMUS/>';
// rest2.owner = rest2.owner && '<ANONIMUS/>';

/* Using the AND assignment Operator.*/

rest1 &&= '<ANONIMUS/>';
rest2 &&= '<ANONIMUS/>';
console.log(rest1);
console.log(rest2);
