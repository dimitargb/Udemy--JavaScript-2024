Scope is the place of our code where our varibales are declared.
Scoping cotrolles how our programm variables are organized and accessed, by the JS Engine.

A function which is written inside of another function has access to the variables of teh parent function.

Scope is a space or invironment in which a certain varibale is declared.

A Scope of a variable is the entire region of our code where a certain var# can be accessed.

We have Global Scope, Function Scope and Block Scope.

1. Global Scope - The Global Scope is for top level code - varibales.
   const me = 'Joanas';
   const job = 'teacher';
   This variables are declared outside if any function or block.
   This variables are accessable everywhere in our programm, in all functions and in all blocks.

2. Function Scope - Each and every function creates a scope. The variables declared inside that function scope are
   only accessible inside that function. This si also called a local scope.

3. Block Scope - everything that is between curly bracers{}
   Example: if(year >= 1981 && year < = 1996){
    const me = true;
    const food = 'Avocado toast';
   }

   console.log('me) // Refference Error
   Variables are accessable only onside the block.
   The block-scopes only apply for variable with let or const, not var.
   Tha variable var can be accessable still outside of the block.

All functions now are block scoped only in strict mode. Functions declared inside a block are only accessable inside that
block. So let and const variables and function are block scope.
