The most common JavaScript runtime is the brouser.

We can imagine the JavaScript runtime as a big container wich includes all the things that we need to use JavaScript
in this case in the brouser.

1. The JavaScript runtime includes the JavaScript Engine. 

2. The web API(everything related to the DOM, Timers, fecth API).
Web API 's are functionalities provided to the Engine but which are nto part of the JavaScript languare itself.
JavaScript gets access to this API's to the global Window Object.

3. Callback queue - this is a data structure taht contains all the callback functions that are ready to be executed.
   For example eventHandler functions. As the event happends for example a 'click', the callback function will be called.
   The first thing what is happening after the event the callback function is put in the callback queue, then when the 
   callStack is empty the callback function is passed to the Stack so that it can be executed.

   This happends by something called the Event Loop.
   The Event Loop takes callback functions from the callback queue and puts them in the callStack so thay can be executed.

JavaScript can exsist outside of brousers. For example in Node.js
Here insted of the API's we have mulitple C++ bindings and the so called therad pulls.
