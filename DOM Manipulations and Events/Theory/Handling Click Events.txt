Event is something that happends on a page. For example mouse click, or a key press or many others.
With the ecnetListener we can wait for certsin venet ot happend and than react to it.

In order to listen to events we firts we need to select the element where the event should happen.
So firts we select this element - Check!

document.querySelector('.check');
anf now on this element we can call the addeventListener() method

Into this addeventListener() method we first need to pass the type of the event.
So the name of the event is 'click'. But now we need to tell the eventListener what to do by definong a function.
This is the second argument we pass in.
This function will contain the code that should be ececuted whenevr this click event happends on this check button.
Inside this function we need to specify what should happen.

What we want to do is to save the number typed into a variable:


document.querySelector('.check').addEventListener('click', function () {
  const guess = document.querySelector('.guess').value;

});

Becuse guess is astring we have to first convert it to a number with the Number function.
After this we have to check wheter there is avalue in the Ckeckbox. If there is no value, 
we print a message and firts we select this element.
