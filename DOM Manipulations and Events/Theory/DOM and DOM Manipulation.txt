DOM is coming form Document Object Model.
DOM is a structured reperesentation of HTML documnets.
The DOM allows us to use JS to access HTML elements and styles in order to manilulate them.

For exsample we are able to change text, HTML, attributes and css styles.
The DOM is a simple connection point between the HTML documnet and JS code.

The DOM is automatically created in the brouser as soon as the HTML page loads and is stored in a tree structure.
In this tree each HTML element is one Object. It starts allways with the DOM Object in the top.
This Object serves as an entry point into the DOM.
 documnet.queryselector();

The queryselector method is available on the documnet Object. We need DOM to start selecting elements.

The first child element od the documnet is usually the html element.

Next HTMLhas 2 child elements <head></head> and <body></body>. They are siblings in the DOM as well.
Inside the head elemnt we have child elemnt title.
Inside the body we have section as child elemnts and inside section we have paragraph and image elements as child
elements os section.

The paragraph has a child the link element <a></a>.

The DOM tree has more then just element Nodes, he also has Nodes for all the text itself, comments and other staff.
The DOM methods are not part of JavaScript, they are part of teh Web API's.

The Web API's are Libraries that the brouser impelemnts. API - Application programming Interface and this
Libraries can interact wiht JavaScript.
