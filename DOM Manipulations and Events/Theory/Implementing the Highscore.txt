First we need a variable for the high score.
let highScore = 0;

This way the first score it's allways gonna be the highScore, becuse is greater than 0.

We will check for the highScore where the player won the game in this if block.

The check we will do is to ask whether the score is greater than the current highScore, than the current score will become
the new highScore.

 if (score > highScore) {
      highScore = score;
       document.querySelector('.highscore').textContent = highScore;
    }
Now all we have to do is to display the new highScore in the box.

 document.querySelector('.highscore').textContent = highScore;
